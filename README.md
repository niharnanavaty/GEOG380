# GEOG380 Final Project
The goal of our program is to be able to find the most efficient route between a user defined list of locations. Usually, the network analyst forces the user to input their desired list of locations in the route every time. This program allows the user to more easily input their list of desired locations by being able to query the list of locations by letter and also to add locations without having to edit a SQL query. Example provided is Landmarks of Washington DC Area.
